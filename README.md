# Welcome ðŸ‘‹  

I'm **Francesco Beretta**, currently in the second year of my MSc in Data Science at the University of Milano Bicocca, after completing a BSc in Statistics. I love working with data: from exploration and modeling to building clear, reproducible pipelines. 

Right now I'm building a solid portfolio that bridges academic work and real-world applications. I believe in understanding models beyond the code, and I enjoy experimenting, questioning results, and learning from mistakes.

### Workspaces

#### ðŸŽ“ University Projects  
Iâ€™m building a dedicated repository where I will publish detailed descriptions of my academic projects.  
The source code will be accessible **upon request**, to respect course policies and academic integrity.

#### ðŸ’¡ Personal Projects  
A separate space dedicated to my independent work: experiments, side projects, and long-term learning challenges.  
This is where I explore different topics from ML pipelines to financial data modeling.

### What drives me

I enjoy working with data that connects to the real economy, exploring financial and economic patterns and translating theory into practical analysis. I like experimenting with machine learning algorithms and applying what I learn during my academic path to real-world datasets. My focus is on understanding data deeply, asking the right questions, and building reliable analytical workflows.
